## Recent Changes

### July 30, 2025 - LaTeX Rendering Error Root Cause Fix
- **Issue**: ALL 50 physics equation boxes contain problematic LaTeX syntax causing render failures
- **Root Cause**: ChatGPT generating LaTeX with \\text{N}, \\text{J} unit annotations that KaTeX rejects
- **Analysis**: Every box contains \\text{} unit commands and escaped backslashes causing pre-rendered LaTeX
- **Solution**: Enhanced preprocessing removes unit annotations like ", (\\text{N})" and all text commands
- **Changes**: Strengthened LaTeX cleaning to handle unit parentheses and improved ChatGPT prompts
- **Status**: âœ“ Completed - Enhanced preprocessing handles all content types with universal auto-fitting

### July 30, 2025 - Tetris-Like Auto-Fitting Layout System
- **Issue**: Boxes were overlapping and creating messy layouts instead of optimal space utilization
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent tetris-like positioning algorithm with collision detection
- **Changes**: 
  - Created sophisticated content analysis for optimal box sizing
  - Built tetris-like positioning algorithm that finds best placement without overlaps
  - Added collision detection with proper spacing margins
  - Implemented space-efficient packing that maximizes page utilization
  - Enhanced auto-arrange to only trigger for new boxes to prevent layout disruption
  - Increased maximum box dimensions to 800x600px for large content
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Refining collision detection and spacing for clean layouts

### July 29, 2025 - ChatGPT Error Handling Improvements
- **Issue**: ChatGPT messages were silently failing due to API quota exceeded
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly toast notifications
- **Changes**: Enhanced chat component with proper error states and messaging
- **Status**: âœ“ Completed - ChatGPT working with new API key

### July 29, 2025 - Modern Resize System Overhaul
- **Issue**: Box resizing was unprofessional, boxes jumping between pages during resize
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite of drag/resize system with modern UX patterns
- **Changes**: 
  - Fixed positioning logic (using `position` instead of `defaultPosition`)
  - Added professional resize handles with gradient styling and smooth transitions
  - Implemented proper drag handle area with visual indicators
  - Added grid snapping (10px) for precise positioning
  - Included debounced auto-save during interactions
  - Added boundary constraints and proper state synchronization
- **Status**: âœ“ Completed - Modern, professional resize experience

### July 29, 2025 - Intelligent Auto-Sizing System
- **Issue**: Boxes required manual resizing regardless of content type (math, physics, essays, chapters)
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent auto-sizing that adapts to content type and length
- **Changes**:
  - Added content analysis for math formulas, long text, and multi-line content
  - Implemented optimal sizing calculations based on content metrics
  - Created specialized sizing for different content types (math vs text vs essays)
  - Added "Auto-fit All" button for manual triggering
  - Increased maximum box dimensions to 800x600px for larger content
  - Auto-sizing applies to new AI-generated boxes automatically
- **Status**: âœ“ Completed - Boxes now auto-fit any content without manual intervention

### July 29, 2025 - Sequential Box Numbering and ChatGPT Operations
- **Issue**: Need numbered boxes for ChatGPT to reference and manipulate specific content
- **Solution**: Added sequential numbering system with full ChatGPT integration
- **Changes**:
  - Added numbered badges (1, 2, 3...) to each box title header
  - Updated ChatGPT system prompt to support numbered box operations
  - Implemented delete, edit, and replace operations via box numbers
  - Added current box context to ChatGPT conversations
  - Enhanced box operation handling with auto-resizing for edited content
- **Status**: âœ“ Completed - ChatGPT can now interact with specific numbered boxes

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

2. **Cheat Sheet Workspace**: Grid-based layout with customizable boxes
3. **Template Workspace**: Structured templates for different academic subjects

### Core Features
- **LaTeX Rendering**: Dynamic mathematical notation rendering via KaTeX

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Frontend makes API requests using TanStack Query
2. Server processes requests with Express middleware chain
3. Data validation occurs at API boundary using Zod schemas
4. Database operations handled through Drizzle ORM
5. Response data cached and synchronized on client

### State Management
- Server state managed by TanStack Query with automatic caching
- Local component state handled by React hooks
- Form state managed by React Hook Form
- Global UI state (toasts, modals) via context providers

### AI Integration
- Chat messages stored per workspace with type and ID
- OpenAI API calls made from server with user context
- Responses integrated into workspace content dynamically
- Chat history maintained for conversation continuity
