 Solution: Paginate the ProseMirror Document Node-by-Node
1. Access the Tiptap JSON document (not just rendered HTML)
js
Copy
Edit
const jsonDoc = editor.getJSON(); // Tiptap content as structured node array
Each block looks like:

js
Copy
Edit
{ type: "paragraph", content: [...] }
2. Create a Paginator function that:
Loops through each node

Temporarily renders each node into a hidden container

Measures its height

Groups them into page arrays

Example Logic:
js
Copy
Edit
let pages = [];
let currentPage = [];
let currentHeight = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < jsonDoc.content.length; i++) {
  const node = jsonDoc.content[i];

  const rendered = renderNodeToElement(node); // Create a temp div with this block

  const height = rendered.offsetHeight;
  if (currentHeight + height > MAX_PAGE_HEIGHT) {
    pages.push(currentPage);
    currentPage = [node];
    currentHeight = height;
  } else {
    currentPage.push(node);
    currentHeight += height;
  }
}
if (currentPage.length) pages.push(currentPage);
You now have pages, where each page is a list of Tiptap nodes that fit within the max height.

3. Render Each Page with EditorContent or NodeRenderer
Now you use each page to render isolated editable pages:

jsx
Copy
Edit
{pages.map((nodes, idx) => (
  <div key={idx} className="page w-[816px] h-[1056px] border mb-8 overflow-hidden">
    <EditorContent editor={createEditorWithNodes(nodes)} />
  </div>
))}
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You‚Äôll likely need to create virtual editors per page if you want all pages editable independently, or you can render non-editable pages for preview mode only.

üß™ Alternative: If you don‚Äôt need editing during pagination
For preview/export only, convert nodes to raw HTML and chunk that directly:

js
Copy
Edit
const html = editor.getHTML(); // full doc
const blockEls = parseHTMLToBlocks(html); // split into <p> or <div> elements
// Then measure and chunk each block like we discussed before
‚úÖ Summary (What You Must Do Differently)
Tiptap won't paginate for you ‚Äî you must chunk its JSON document or rendered HTML into measured pieces.

Just copying and pasting content adds it to the root doc ‚Äî it has no concept of page breaks.

Paginate before rendering, not after it's already in .ProseMirror.
