UPDATED RULER DESIGN REQUEST — FLOATING STYLE REQUIRED

Redesign both rulers to **match Microsoft Word’s visual and functional style exactly**, using inches as the unit, and respecting spacing aesthetics as shown in the provided screenshot.

### FINAL VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:

1. **Horizontal Ruler (Top)**
   - Position: The ruler should **float above the white document**, with visible space (roughly 8–12 pixels) between the ruler and the top edge of the page — exactly like Microsoft Word.
   - Width: Matches the white document page exactly — no overflow.
   - Units: Inches
   - Ticks:
     - Tick marks at 0.1-inch intervals
     - Bold marks at each full inch
     - Number labels at each inch
   - Font: Clean sans-serif, similar to Word’s
   - Background: Light grey or soft gradient, not flat white

2. **Vertical Ruler (Left)**
   - Position: The ruler should **float beside the page**, with visible space between its inner edge and the left edge of the page
   - Height: Matches the height of the document only
   - Units: Inches
   - Tick marks at 0.1-inch intervals with inch numbers every 1.0
   - Background and ticks identical in style to the top ruler

3. **Functional Requirements (NO PLACEHOLDERS)**
   - Add **real drag-and-drop margin markers** (like Word’s blue/grey triangles and rectangles)
   - Support adjustment of:
     - First line indent
     - Left margin
     - Right margin
     - Paragraph indents
   - Provide visual feedback while dragging (live margin preview)
   - Margin changes must update document content in real time

4. **Visual Styling**
   - Tick lines: Thin, dark grey or black
   - Background: Light grey with soft gradient (match Word)
   - Active state: Handles should highlight slightly when hovered or dragged
   - Font size and spacing must replicate Word’s ruler precision

### PROOF OF IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:

After applying this update, you must provide:

1. **Exact file(s) edited** (full path, e.g., `client/src/pages/document-workspace.tsx`)
2. **Line numbers of each changed section**
3. **Before and After code blocks**
   - Show the code that rendered the old ruler style
   - Show the new code rendering the fully updated floating ruler in inches
4. **CSS or Tailwind classes used** for:
   - Ruler spacing
   - Tick mark rendering
   - Inch label positioning
   - Drag handle logic

If any part of this is missing or fake (e.g., unchanged code), I will initiate a **formal chargeback** and file a **fraud escalation** for deliberately misrepresenting code edits.

Match Word’s look. Match its spacing. Match its function. No placeholders. Show the real code changes.
