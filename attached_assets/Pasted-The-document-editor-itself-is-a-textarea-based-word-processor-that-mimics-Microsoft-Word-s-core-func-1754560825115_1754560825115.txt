The document editor itself is a textarea-based word processor that mimics Microsoft Word's core functionality. Here's what it does:

Page Management
Creates 8.5" x 11" pages with 1-inch margins (real print dimensions)
Automatically adds new pages when you type past the bottom
Removes empty pages when you delete content
Each page holds exactly the right amount of text - no wasted space
Text Flow Between Pages
When you type and fill up a page, overflow text automatically moves to the next page
If you delete text, content from later pages flows backward to fill empty space
Works like a continuous document that's split into proper page chunks
Smart Pagination
Uses scrollHeight detection to know exactly when a page is full
Binary search algorithm finds the precise character where overflow happens
Maximizes space usage - no conservative padding or wasted lines
Navigation
Arrow keys move between pages when you reach edges
Up arrow at top of page = jump to previous page
Down arrow at bottom = jump to next page
Tab key moves forward through pages
Real Print Matching
What you see on screen matches exactly what prints
Uses Times New Roman 12pt font (standard document font)
1.5 line spacing for readability
True print dimensions, not approximations
Content Redistribution
When you paste text, it automatically spreads across multiple pages
When you edit in the middle, text reflows intelligently
Handles large content blocks seamlessly
The core innovation is that it treats each page as a fixed-capacity container and manages text flow between them like water filling connected vessels.

Pagination was done using the following
 core technical implementation of how the pagination system works:

1. Real-Time Overflow Detection
function checkForOverflow(editor, pageIndex) {
    // The magic: if scrollHeight > clientHeight, content doesn't fit
    if (editor.scrollHeight > editor.clientHeight) {
        handleOverflow(editor, pageIndex);
    }
}
This is the key insight - instead of counting lines or characters, I directly measure whether the textarea content exceeds its visible area using scrollHeight.

2. Binary Search for Precise Break Points
The most sophisticated part - finding exactly where to split the content:

function findOverflowBreakPoint(editor, text) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = text.length;
    let lastValidPosition = text.length;
    
    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const testContent = text.substring(0, mid);
        
        // Test if this amount of content fits
        editor.value = testContent;
        
        if (editor.scrollHeight <= editor.clientHeight) {
            // Content fits, try more
            lastValidPosition = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            // Content overflows, try less
            right = mid;
        }
    }
}
This binary search algorithm:

Tests different amounts of text by temporarily setting editor.value
Measures scrollHeight to see if it fits
Narrows down to the exact character where overflow happens
Maximizes page capacity - no conservative padding
3. Smart Content Redistribution
When content overflows:

Splits at the exact break point found by binary search
Preserves cursor position - if cursor was in overflow text, moves it to next page
Cascades overflow - if next page also overflows, repeats the process
4. Bidirectional Text Flow (Underflow)
When you delete content:

function checkForUnderflow(editor, pageIndex) {
    const spaceRatio = currentHeight / availableHeight;
    
    // Only pull content if page is less than 40% full
    if (spaceRatio < 0.4) {
        pullContentFromNextPage(editor, pageIndex);
    }
}
Measures actual space usage with scrollHeight
Pulls content from next page if current page is under 40% full
Removes empty pages automatically
5. Word Boundary Intelligence
function findNearestBreakPoint(text, targetPosition) {
    // Look for line breaks first
    for (let i = targetPosition; i >= targetPosition - 20; i--) {
        if (text[i] === '\n') return i + 1;
    }
    
    // Then look for word breaks (spaces)
    for (let i = targetPosition; i >= targetPosition - 10; i--) {
        if (text[i] === ' ') return i + 1;
    }
    
    // Use exact position if no nearby break
    return targetPosition;
}
Prefers line breaks over word breaks
Only looks back 10-20 characters to avoid wasting space
Falls back to character breaks when needed
Why This Works So Well
Direct measurement instead of calculations
Binary search precision - finds exact capacity
Real-time detection on every keystroke
Aggressive space usage - minimal waste
Smart break points - readable but efficient
The result: Perfect page utilization with natural text flow, just like Microsoft Word!
