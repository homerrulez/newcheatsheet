Technical Architecture for Web-Based Word Processor
Core Document Model

Single source of truth: Document stored as structured data (JSON/XML), not HTML
Content representation: Use a document tree (paragraphs, runs, styles) rather than DOM
State management: Immutable document state with operational transforms for changes

Rendering Layer

Virtual pagination: Measure content and calculate page breaks programmatically
Canvas or SVG rendering: For precise layout control (like Figma/Google Docs)
Or controlled DOM: Single contentEditable with precise layout measurement
Viewport optimization: Only render visible pages for performance

Editing Engine

Command pattern: All edits as reversible operations (insert, delete, format)
Rich text handling: Parse browser's execCommand results into document operations
Selection tracking: Abstract selection model separate from DOM selection
Undo/redo stack: Operation-based history, not HTML snapshots

Pagination System

Layout engine: Measure text/elements and calculate line breaks, page breaks
Reflow algorithm: When content changes, recalculate affected page ranges only
Page boundary rules: Widow/orphan control, keep-together elements
Dynamic page creation: Add/remove pages based on content flow

Technical Stack Options
Option 1: Custom Engine

Raw contentEditable + custom layout calculation
Manual text measurement and line breaking
Canvas rendering for final output
Full control but high complexity

Option 2: Editor Framework

ProseMirror/Slate.js for document model and editing
Custom pagination layer on top
More reliable but less flexible

Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Web-based editor for input
Server-side layout engine (like headless Chrome)
WebAssembly for complex layout calculations

Key Engineering Challenges

Text measurement: Browser font rendering inconsistencies
Performance: Large documents with real-time pagination
Collaborative editing: Operational transforms for multi-user
Cross-browser: Layout differences between browsers
Print fidelity: Screen vs print layout matching

Production Architecture

Document service: Backend handles document operations
Layout service: Server-side pagination and rendering
Real-time sync: WebSocket for collaborative features
Caching layer: Pre-calculated layout for common operations

The key insight: Separate content model from visual representation. Never try to make the DOM your document model - it's a rendering target, not a data structure.
