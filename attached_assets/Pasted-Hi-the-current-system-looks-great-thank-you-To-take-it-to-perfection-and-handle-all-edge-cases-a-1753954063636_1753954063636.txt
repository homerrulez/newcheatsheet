Hi, the current system looks great — thank you! To take it to perfection and handle all edge cases across content types and screen sizes, here are the additional tips and improvements I’d like you to consider:

---

1. **Dynamic Content Fitting**  
   - Ensure all box content is fully visible (no clipping or overflow).  
   - Use `ResizeObserver` or contentHeight + padding to dynamically size boxes.  
   - Support LaTeX, long strings, and multiline content equally well.

2. **Page-Aware Vertical Flow**  
   - Maintain accurate vertical placement across pages using:
     `top = pageIndex * (pageHeight + spacing)`  
   - Boxes that exceed `pageHeight` should auto-flow to next page.  
   - Track per-page column heights to avoid collisions.

3. **Adaptive Masonry Columns**  
   - Adjust number of columns based on density setting:
     - Spacious: 2 columns  
     - Balanced: 3 columns  
     - Compact: 4+ columns  
   - Use CSS grid or manual absolute positioning for placement.
   - Maintain consistent gutter/margin between boxes.

4. **Responsive Density Controls (Top Toolbar)**  
   - Let users pick from:
     - Compact (18–20 boxes/page)  
     - Balanced (12–16/page)  
     - Spacious (8–10/page)  
   - Re-trigger smart layout when this setting changes.

5. **Drag Compatibility**  
   - Preserve drag-and-drop functionality.  
   - On manual drag, temporarily disable smart layout for that box.

6. **Intelligent Reflow**  
   - On adding new content or resizing window, reflow boxes only if `smartLayout` is active.  
   - Avoid jank during reflows using `requestAnimationFrame` or throttled updates.

7. **Minimum Box Width Enforcement (Fix Resizing Bug)**  
   - Current issue: when manually resizing a box, it sometimes “snaps back” to a larger min-width.  
   - Solution:  
     - Explicitly set `minWidth` and `minHeight` via props/styles.  
     - Remove any flex/grid constraints that override manual sizing.  
     - Optional: add a "disable autoresize" toggle.

8. **Edge Case Handling**  
   - Handle long LaTeX expressions or matrix-style math.  
   - Prevent overflow by wrapping or auto-scaling LaTeX with `\displaystyle` and CSS scaling.  
   - Optional: truncate or show "expand" if box hits max height.

9. **Visual Transitions (Optional)**  
   - Add smooth layout transitions (e.g., fade/slide on reposition).  
   - Use `framer-motion` or CSS transitions if performance allows.

10. **Export Optimization (Optional)**  
    - When printing or saving, recalculate layout at 100% scale.  
    - Ensure all boxes are confined within printable area (no overflow).

If you'd like, I can test it with some random complex formulas to verify the behavior across multiple content types and box shapes. Let me know when this is applied!
