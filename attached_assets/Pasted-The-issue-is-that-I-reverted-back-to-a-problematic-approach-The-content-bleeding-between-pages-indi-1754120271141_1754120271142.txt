Ask Claude 4 this specific question:

"I have a Tiptap editor that needs to behave exactly like Microsoft Word with true pagination. Currently I have:

A single continuous EditorContent component positioned absolutely over visual page frames

Text is bleeding between pages instead of being contained within page boundaries

Pages are 816x1056px with 64px padding, but content overflows between them

The core issue is: How do I make a single Tiptap editor respect page boundaries so content doesn't show between pages while still allowing seamless editing across multiple pages?

Show me the exact CSS and React component structure needed to clip content to page boundaries while maintaining one continuous editing surface."

This will help us get the proper technical solution for content clipping within page boundaries while maintaining the seamless editing experience you need.
