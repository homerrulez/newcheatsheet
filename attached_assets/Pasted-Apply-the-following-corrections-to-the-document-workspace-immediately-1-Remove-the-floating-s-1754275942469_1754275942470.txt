Apply the following corrections to the document workspace immediately:

1. **Remove the floating status bar above the document**
   - Delete the bar that says: “AI Assistant Active • 9 words • 1 min read • Auto-save”
   - The page should begin directly below the toolbar with no floating metadata.

2. **Restore the original toolbar background**
   - The current toolbar background is incorrect — it shows a pale or pinkish-white tone.
   - It should be a soft blue, identical to the blue used in the chat session box on the left panel.
   - Use that same blue consistently across the entire toolbar region.

3. **Unify button styles across the toolbar**
   - Every button in the toolbar must use the same grey style — the same grey that is already applied to most buttons.
   - No button (like the color picker or formatting buttons) should be highlighted yellow, white, or look visually different unless actively hovered or pressed.
   - Keep all buttons consistent in padding, border radius, and font weight.

4. **Clean the upper-right UI**
   - Remove all floating elements in the upper-right margin: status dots, auto-save badges, assistant tags, etc.
   - That area should be completely blank, matching the top edge of the document space.

5. **Add a horizontal ruler**
   - Insert a standard ruler (like in Microsoft Word) directly above the document page but below the toolbar.
   - It should display measurement markers (inches or centimeters) and stay flush with the top edge of the white document canvas.
   - This ruler is critical for alignment and layout guidance.

6. **Fix overall color consistency**
   - The background above the toolbar and around it must also be that same soft blue — not white, not pink.
   - No part of the top interface should use white or pink by default.

Do not introduce unapproved visual changes, and do not hide these changes behind assistive logic or themes. Apply them universally to all document pages unless otherwise specified.
